## CSS

> It kinda works already (sort of, maybe)

- CSS' fault vs. our own fault
  + Lack of knowledge about the project
  + No established foundation
  + More features, more lines of code
  + No documentation
  + Web UI development is still pretty hard
- Simple but not easy
  + The cascade
  + Theming
  + Code reuse
  + Everything is global by default
