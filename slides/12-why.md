## Why

> Why a team of soon-to-be-a-hundred might be interested in this approach

- Having a design system enforces consistency and speed things up
  + No magic numbers
  + Build new UIs without adding new components
  + Strong brand identity
  + Easily bootstrap new internal products
  + Multitenancy problem
- Primitives for the win (the DOM/CSSOM is just a technicality)
    - Design tokens
    - React Native
    - Electron
- Components are self sufficient
    + No build steps required
    + Small footprint
    + Easier to test
- Pain from design changes is a **feature**
    + As the system grows, assumptions should be revisited
    + Engineers and designers should work close together
