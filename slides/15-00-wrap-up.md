## Wrap up

### Good stuff

- JavaScript
- No CSS
  + Forget about namespacing
  + Forget about the cascade
- Components as first class citizens
- No extra build step required
- Existing tooling already works (HMR, error overlay, tree shaking, etc)
- UI primitives for the win (the DOM/CSSOM is just a technicality)

### Gotchas

- JavaScript
- FUD
- Team must be up for it
- You should rethink how you bundle
